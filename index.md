**Hey there, nice to meet you!**  

My name is Michael Cata. I'm an R nerd, National Park hiker, Bob Seger fan, tech translater, wannabe economist, and not-your-average management consultant.

I help (mostly large) organizations understand their potential and avoid the risks of becoming the next Enron, Kodak, or (soon to be) IBM. Restructuring, product development, cross-disciplinary teams, APIs, opportunity costs, and design sprints are words that perk my ears.

Today I work for the Federal Government with a bunch of great folk at <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov">18F</a>. We're public servants helping other public servants moderize their approach to mission. We improve the workings of bureaucracy through prototypes, transformation initiatives, user-centered research, assisted acquisitions, and even full-blown product builds.

If you're into preventing organization collapse or where not to eat street meat in NYC check out some of my [blog posts](/read) or [portfolio](/work).
